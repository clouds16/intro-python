1) This assignemtn gave me some difficulty. I probably spent 6 hours on this assignemtn.
and i rewatched the videos multiple times.

2) first assginment was the easiest

3) I had good logic, but my program kept nopt generating values for the instance of the class that
that was the value in the key-value pair. After many reworks of the code and iterations, i figured
out that i was missing a __repr__ method in the claass, and that it was for printing the class . (kept 
getting an object that was printing, but no values). also creating the dict took awhile to get to 
a correct formatting
